That makes your half-max rep total 5 reps (10 divided by 2). If you can only do 5 total reps, your half-max total is 2 to 3. Perform your half-max rep total every minute on the minute for 10 minutes. If you complete the reps before the end of the minute, rest until the next minute begins.Hang block: You can perform this a couple of ways. Option A: Hang for as long as you can, resting only when needed. Continue for 10 minutes.Option B: Hang for 30 seconds, and then rest for 30 seconds. Repeat for 10 minutes total. Every week, add a second of work and remove a second of rest to these time periods."
